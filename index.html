            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I'm Ayokunle Olugboyo, a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Illinois - Chicago, passionate about software engineering and always ready to tackle challenging projects and solving problems. 
                My last year of High School provided a deep dive into the world of coding, igniting my passion for software development. 
                In my college years, I was able to learn and explore my passions to solve problems in creative ways.
                During the time I do not code, I enjoy working out, listening to songs, hanging out with friends and family, learning new technology tools and just watch TV.
            </p>
